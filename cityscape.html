                <h3>City before Sundown</h3>
                    <p>Beautiful city structure before the sun sets. <br>
                        I took this picture right before sundown.  I wanted a pretty sunset 
                        effect, and looks like I got it on the clouds.

                <h3>Building of All Shapes and Sizes</h3>
                    <p>This building is one of my favourites.  Each structure is built in different
                        shapes and sizes.  I think that's what makes them unique.

                <h3>Birds eye View</h3>
                    <p>When you get up very high, you sometimes never relize that everything is a lot smaller.
                        When I took this picture.  I could only imagine if this is what birds see when they are up flying around.

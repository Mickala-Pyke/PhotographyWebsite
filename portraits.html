            <h2>Portrait Photos</h2>
            <p>Portraits are a great way of taking peoples Personality. <br> You have to be able to have good lighting, enviornment, and most 
                importantly, a great smile. That's what I have learned while taking these photos.</p>

                <h3>A Shadow in a Doorway</h3>
                    <p> 
                        Since it was a bit daker, I wanted to try a shadow figure look.  So once I saw this frame, I thought it would be a great oportunity
                        to try my idea out. <br> The final result was this image, and I thought it turned out pretty well for a first try.

                <h3>Young Joy</h3>
                    <p>
                        I was a photographer for a festival and they were doing a baby competition.  I was told to take pictures and this one was one of
                        my many favourites.  The two looked so happy and cute together and the child had the biggest smile,
                         which to me, made this picture even better.

                <h3>Stare into the Light</h3>
                    <p>
                        I was just starting to experement with portraits and I was on a walk while trying to find a good spot to pactice.  Then there was
                        this bridge that was amazing, so I decides to practice on it. <br>
                        My model was very suportive and eventualy we got a great shot.

                <h3>The Bird with Many Words</h3>
                    <p>
                        This bird is one of a kind.  Even though many brids do speak, I find that this one can communicated in
                        full sentences when told.  This bird's colour is also one of my favoute things about them, becuase there are many different
                        colours to this kind of bird.

                <h3>The bridge of Reflection</h3>
                    <p>I love this image becuase of it's reflection.  You don't always get a good reflection out of some waters, but this time,
                        I got an oportunity to get an amazing mirror shot with a bridge and its surroundings.

                <h3>Glow in the Dark JellyeFish</h3>
                    <p>
                        This Jellyfish was taken at an Aquarium called, Ripleys.  I always love going there becuase I love sealife.  I was 
                        unsure if I was going to be able to take a good picture of this beucase of the glass, but it actualy turned out rwally good.
                        Almost like I was in the tank with it.

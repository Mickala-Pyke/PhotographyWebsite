            <p>Hi! My name is Mickala Pyke and I am a nature/wildlife photogrpaher.  I am currently in post secondary at Humber college
                studying in Multimedia Design and development.  I am hoping to beccome a profssional photogrpaher one day, but also put 
                my design skills from what I learn in college to my future also.  I am 19 years of age and currently live in Ontario Canada!
                I was born and raised in a town called, Toronto Ontario. <br>
                I have been doing photogrpahy for almost 5 years now and my skills have been improving a lot. <br>
                When I started doing photogrpahy back in highschool, my pictures were very blurry and I didn't really know much about lighting, 
                positioning, ect.  Now that I know all that now, my photogrpahy skills have improve a lot over the years.<br>
                I am also currenlty employeed as a lifeguard and swim instructor, and I love doing that job.  Although, I love that job, photogrpahy
                is my realy passion.  I wanna be successfull just like my grandfather was with his photogrpahy buisness.<br>
                I really hope you like my work, and look forward to seeing more upcoming photos soon!
